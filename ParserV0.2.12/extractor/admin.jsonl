Project #5: ABIS(Activity Based Information System)  Description: Activity Based Costing depicts an accurate picture of the  real cost  of  doing  business,  by  understanding  the  processes, activities, products, customers, their inter-dependencies and the costs associated  with them. The ABIS Model maps the resource expenses into Cost elements and  Cost Element  groups.  The  Cost  Element  and  cost  element  groups represent hierarchy levels of the resource expenses. The resources represent  the  cost  base  for  the  model.  The resource expenses like  salaries,  wages,  travel,  depreciation,  etc.  are linked to the cost  centers  in  the  GL  accounting  system.  The  resource expenses will be taken to activities  from  cost  centers  through  Resource Drivers.  Resource  Drivers  are  bases  of  allocation  of resources to activities. They represent the  best  single  quantitative  measure  of  the frequency and intensity of demands placed on a resource by the activities. The  ABIS  model  drives  operating  expenses  not only to production and marketing activities, but also to  activities  that  are  not directly linked to direct conversion of raw material  into  finished  goods. For Ex, Administration, HR,  Purchase,  etc.  The  ABIS  model  defines  the drivers for allocation of expenses to activities,  products,  customers  and their segments. First the Department to activity  allocation  is  taken  the cost from Trail balance and allocated to department wise and  then  activity wise. Once the Expenses are taken to direct activities, the cost  are allocated to the products and their segments. This is done  by  an  activity to product drivers. And then we can use the activity to customer driver  the marketing and sales department expenses  are  taken  to  Customer  wise  and their segment wise. And finally we can  see  the  many  different  types  of profit report  and  difficult  cost  report  for  each  and  every  product, customer and activity wise.

I have designed, developed and implemented the security and most of the software development for the Catholic Social Service’s Great Plains application portal as well as their time tracking system and their shift scheduling system. These systems pulled data from the Great Plains Interface a database which I developed that uses a SSIS program which I wrote to maintain the database. Information was pulled back into Great Plains using a number of views which pulled the information into Project and from there the information flowed to Time Card. I designed and implemented a database interface for Colleague to allow all the in house applications a single point interface to the Colleague database. I have also designed, developed and implemented a security viewer application, print manager application and equipment booking application for the Colleague database. At Ormed Information Systems I re-wrote the month end process for the Asset Management System which is part of their hospital ERP. At Design Group I built several applications for time entry and electronic document management. Career History  2013 – Present Design Group  2012 – 2013 Ormed Information Systems, Asset Management System  2010 – 2012 Assiniboine Community College Print Manager Automation  2008 – 2010 Catholic Social Services, Application Portal, Shift Scheduler, Time Tracker  2006 – 2008 Sierra Systems, PeopleSoft system maintenance, Telus Contractor (Medgate System)  2005 – 2006 Alberta Gov’t, Education Department, Applications Development, System Analyst 2004 – 2006 Northern Light Systems, Programmer/Analyst  1999 – 2010 Plant People, Owner/Operator  1985 – 1999 Tigney Technology, Research and Development Work Experience Software and Languages  Design Group  Designed and built the electronic document signing interface. This interface allows Design Group staff to process documents and contracts that were signed electronically. The system recorded the documents and the document state during various phases of the document signing process. After the document was signed the document is stored in the system and can be retrieved later. The system interfaced with the DocuSign system.  This program was written in C#. The database and stored procedures were written on SQL Server 2008.  I was part of a 2 person development team the designed and built an interface to Bullhorn. This interface validated information that was entered by contractors, updated the Great Plains Avanti and Pam modules. The application also wrote back job numbers and employee IDs that were created in Great Plains to Bullhorn. This program was written in C#. The database and stored procedures were written on SQL Server 2008. The Bullhorn objects were imported using JSON.  Designed and built the web time entry systems for offsite Design Group Syncrude contractors to use to enter time and projects they assigned time too. This program was written in C#. The database and stored procedures were written on SQL Server 2008.  Data validation on Design Group information contained the Bullhorn database.  Fixed and changed a number of SSRS reports.  Presently designing and building a system using SSIS to import time from Design Group contractors working at Enbridge. This time will be imported into the Pam module in Great Plains. The system will handle adjustments.  The data was imported in a text file from Enbridge. This program used SSIS to modify the data and populate the appropriate files that are imported into Great Plains.  Enhanced the Professional Advantage Web Time Emails. Generated the emails from a html template instead of a database generated email to allow for a header with images, a footer with a disclaimer and display the proper links and message depending on the company the contractor  was hired from and if the contractor had approver privileges  and the type of approver they are.  I am presently part of 2 person team building a wellness reimbursement application that will allow users to submit wellness claims. Ormed Information Systems  The asset management application is part of the Ormed Financial Suite. This application is a windows VB6 application that uses VB6 code to transfer information to and from the database which interfaces with the general ledger. The first step was to re- write the month end segment of the application into SQL to allow reports to be viewed prior to values be committed to the database and allow the database to be rolled back if errors were encountered. One of the requirements was that the month end process be run from the current application. To do this all of the code, including the control logic and business logic had to built into SQL. To accomplish this number of month end tables were added to the database. I also had to design and build the SQL into three layers, a control layer, a business logic layer and a database access layer. This is presently in the last stages of testing. Assiniboine Community College  Colleague Interface Database  This database was designed to be a data access point for all of the custom written software that required information from the Colleague ERP. This system provided security for the ERP by providing a single point of access and validated the data being pulled from the Colleague ERP to prevent problems in the custom written applications.  The database was built on SQL Server 2005 using SSIS.  Equipment Bookings  I designed and implemented the Equipment Bookings System to allow staff to see thumbnails of promotional equipment, book equipment and notify all stakeholders by email. This system also displayed a calendar of equipment bookings. This software was built using VB .Net in Visual Studio 2010 on the .Net 4 framework. The database was built on SQL Server 2005 and pulled information from Active Directory.  Security Viewer  I designed and implemented the Security Viewer to allow security to view photos and department information of staff members using swipe cards to access swipe card enabled areas of the college. This software was built using VB .Net in Visual Studio 2010 on the .Net 4 framework. The database was built on SQL Server 2005 and pulled information from Active Directory.  Print Manager Print Quota Management  I designed this system and I am presently in the final testing stages. This system detects new students and student course changes in the Colleague ERP and updates student print quota, print credit information in one of 8 Print Manager databases located on 8 separate physical servers. This system also keeps a history of all transactions. The user interface was built using C# .Net in Visual Studio 2010 on the .Net 4 framework. The database was built on SQL Server 2005 and includes 2 SSIS projects to pull the information from the Colleague Interface Database and to track and record the changes on the 8 Print Manager databases Catholic Charities / Catholic Social Services   The Great Plains Interface Database  This database was designed to be a data access point for all of the custom written software that required information from the Great Plains ERP. This system provided security for the Great Plains ERP by providing a single point of access and validated the data being pulled from the Great Plains ERP to prevent problems in the custom written applications. The database was built on SQL Server 2008 using SQL Server 2005 SSIS.   Catholic Social Services Application Portal  I redesigned an application portal to control access to the various custom web based software applications written over a 10 year period. I designed the security for all of the software applications and was first accessed through the Application Portal and referenced by any subsequent software applications that were accessed through the portal. This software also included an employee messaging system that was tied in to the employee group home scheduling system. This system was written in VB .Net using Visual Studio 2005. The database was built on SQL Server 2008 and pulled information from the Great Plains Interface Database.  Catholic Social Services Shift Scheduling System  I redesigned this web based system to allow employees to schedule shifts in one or many of the about 50 different group’s homes run by Catholic Social Service in Northern Alberta. The system notified employees by the messaging system in the Application Portal when requested shifts were approved or declined. This system also allowed supervisors and managers to schedule shifts. This system was written in VB using Visual Studio 2005. The database was built on SQL Server 2008 and pulled information from the Great Plains Interface Database.  Great Plains Time and Attendance System  I designed the Great Plains Time Entry System to allow employees from Catholic Charities and Catholic Social Services to enter time and project information that was uploaded into the Great Plains ERP It allowed time entry for about 1500 employees. The employees were able to enter project, departments, sick days and vacations based on information that was pulled into the Great Plains Interface database. This system allowed for approvals and modifications based on a security value assigned to each employee, and included custom interfaces for the payroll department to approve, reject and modify any employees time. The final information was loaded into a staging table and then pulled into the Great Plains ERP and then uploaded to the Avanti system. Sierra Systems   PeopleSoft maintenance and application enhancements  I have experience writing SQR reports and tracking data problems with the Alberta Workers Compensation on their Information Financial Management System and Human Resources Information System. I did development work using the PeopleSoft ERP.  Medgate  I was trained to maintain the Medgate system that the Alberta government uses to track equipment and training for all of the health care workers in Alberta. I was sub contracted to Telus for this project.  Calgary Private School system data conversion to PeopleSoft  This system used Access to pull, modify and upload information to a PeopleSoft database. I was sub contracted to Telus for this project.  Captiva  I was trained on image capture software used by the Alberta Workers Compensation Board Alberta Education   RACERS  Most of my time was spent maintaining the Revenue Allocation and Credit Enrollment Reporting System. This was a VB 6 Asp application that tracked student’s courses, locations and course credits. This application also tracked the various schools revenue allocation. Northern Light Systems   Northern Lights Systems was a registered name that I used to do charity work.   Support Network  Designed and built a distress line volunteer scheduler. This was built using C# using Visual Studio 2003 on an SQL Server 2000 database.

Worked with IBM at various levels during the migration of data. Architected a solution that was a complete Refactor of a legacy application which was ending its term. The new OFSLL application dependent on Oracle’s RAC component for the Oracle Database. As part of finding an equivalent solution supported on Azure’s backbone network, I lead efforts to engage a market place vendor (FlashGrid.io) and evaluate the Oracle RAC solution being offered from them. This became an agreed upon solution by all stakeholders and even Oracle certified as a supported solution they would deploy OFSLL services on.  SAP Migration to Azure: Helped architected, Engineer solution to migrate SAP workloads to Azure. Tasks include choosing RHEL 7 as the supported OS in lieu of Suse Linux, right sizing the SAP Hana VMs for Azure, Planning storage, setting up glusterfs storage for SAP Netweaver instances. Creating HA cluster for SAPs ASCS/ERS instances utilizing pacemaker and fence agent to achieve HA in addition to glusterfs shared filesystems for Netweaver. Work with SAP Basis team on a regular basis and collaborate across teams to achieve various tasks and address several hiccups during the process of this migration.  Worked with Developers to help adopt the use of Azure’s Functions and Web Apps over traditional VMs running the .jar(s); tested several use cases with the code now running in Azure Functions and Web Apps. This made use of Azure APIM as the frontend to secure the APIs via the use of policies and API keys. Azure Functions ran as a backend service which in turn call internal resources running within the private vnet space. Test Drive a PoC utilizing Azure EventHub for the middleware solution, worked with Integration development teams to help drive adoption of these services with Kafka broker enabled for the Event Hub namespace. Helped setup RHEL standards and operation procedures at Kubota, these include usage of Open SCAP template’s for SOX audits/compliance, applying OS hardenings to the image, deploying images via packer, using powershell scripts to build VMs. (Terraform is in works currently). Worked with On-Prem team to integrate On-Prem AD with Azure AD. This includes synching the AD with Azure’s AD and also extending the On-Prem AD-DC to Azure’s Vnet Space to enable DNS resolutions across different sites.  Implemented Foreman to manage the Azure hosts, RHEL Subscriptions, Yum repositories, Content hosts, etc.   Very good understanding of Jenkins, helped onboard Cloudbees as our Jenkins implementation partner  AWS Solutions Architect (As a freelancer with upwork) Well versed with Cloud Economics & performing a TCO to aid with the on boarding of AWS and provide the value proposition that comes with AWS.  Helped migrate a workload to the AWS cloud. This was for a client based in UAE. Customer had evaluated AWS and they wanted to make the switch, this is where I came in. I helped evaluate their current workload using AWS best practices. I worked with the Application team on customers side to ensure the application is Cloud-Aware and recommend some best practices that should be incorporated such as Resiliency to failure and latency. Came up with a resilient fault tolerant architecture for the Application to reside on AWS and helped migrate the Application over to the cloud.  Helped a customer fix a \"redirect issue\" with his website. I architected a new solution with the use of additional EC2 instances, made use of Route53 and changed the origin for his CDN, and created an Alias A record for his other m.domain.com website and passed it through the ELB, that not only fixed the \"Too many Redirects\" errors, it also gave him a resilient solution to his existing opencart website. In addition to this I have proposed setting up HealthCheck by making use of Cloudwatch in order to generate alerts when any of his EC2 instance fails the healthcheck, also used cloudwatch to setup billing alerts for the client when the monthly invoice hits a particular threshold/budget.  Created a highly resilient and scalable Wordpress site using Apache, PHP, php-mysql and mysql RDS instance. I used 4 subnets (2 public and 2 private), made use of NAT gateway to allow instances in Private subnet access to Internet, The mysql servers resided in the Private Subnets with Multi-AZ enabled. Made use of ELB to route traffic between the two EC2 instances in the public SN hosting the wordpress site. Made use of CDN to serve images instead of the EC2 instance by enabling URL rewrites. Also made use of Auto scaling, AMIs to make this architecture truly fault-tolerant and Highly Resilient. Configured and setup a VPC that uses a Bastion Host to Access hosts within the Private Subnets of the VPC, this was to provide additional security and also to allow the EC2 instances access to Internet without the possibility of outside traffic reaching the hosts in the Private Subnet directly.  Made use of Cloud Formation templates to deploy a multi-tier AWS infrastructure, configured the cloudformation template to include customization based on the requirements.

Having hands on experience on Core java programming, MVC Architecture, JSF, JSP, HTML, JavaScript, backbone JS AngularJS (Version 4/7).  Having knowledge of JSF Framework, spring, and JPA Concept using Hibernate.  Having Knowledge on WebService, MicroService, REST API.  Having hands on experience on SQL Developer, Oracle (9i/10g) database. Technical Skills  Software Languages  Core Java(5,6)   GUI  Jsp, HTML, JSF, JavaScript, Scriplets, Backbone Js, Angular js, Webservice, Micro service   Framework  JSF ,Spring ,Hibernate   Operating Systems  Windows   IDE  Eclipse(Indigo),BEA 10, Spring Tool Suite, VSCode   Version Control  VSS,SVN,RTC,Git   Application Server  Weblogic, IBM Websphere 7, PCF   Database  Pl/SQL Developer, Oracle (9i/10g) Project Details The details of the various Projects that I have handled are listed here, in chronological order Wealth Insight (October 2018 – Till Date)  Roles and Responsibilities: In this project, I have worked as Developer at Client location. Here I am working in Angular JS 7. Wealth Insight is what we call an \"Insight\" experience. When a user logs in to online banking, their dashboard lists all the accounts they have at PNC. One of these tiles will be their wealth insight tile, clicking the button takes them to the wealth insight experience Here basically we are decoupling the application from the PNC online banking services.. The exiting online banking services was developed in angular 1.6. But Using Angular 7 we are decoupling our application so that in future it can be deployed independently without affecting the other modules. Environment: Angular 7  IDE: VSCode Client: PNC  Company: CGI Citi Commercial – Gateway (September 2017 – September 2018)  Roles and Responsibilities: In this project I have worked as Developer at Client location. Here I am working in MicroService REST APIs , Angular JS 4. Gateway is application which establishes connection between Citi's Internal and External User. This application removes all the paper work which is needed for any kind of product like Account Opening, Cash management. So Citi's Internal user will do all the pre set-up for any client during Account opening through this portal then the request will be sent to Customer to fill up all the Customer specific data. The whole process will be achieved via a set of form journey for various product. It’s a paperless activity. Here the font end web pages are being developed using angular 4 and from UI we call backend MicroServices  API (Spring Boot). The MicroServices are being deployed in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and also being registered in Eureka. So from application if we want to call any MicroServices we use DiscoveryClient to get the service which are registered in Eureka. The API configuration are defined via Swagger 2.0. Environment: Spring Boot MicroService API, Angular 4  Application Server: Pivotal Cloud Foundry IDE: Spring Tool Suite, VSCode Client: Citi Commercial Bank  Company: TCS Customer Complaint Tracking (Jun 2014 - August 2017)  Roles and Responsibilities Here I was involved as service end developer. Here I am working on Web Service, JPA, Core Java and Spring. Apart from that I have little bit of work experience on Backbone.js, JSON and JQuery. Environment: Core Java 6, Hibernate,  Application Server: Websphere Application Server v7.0 IDE: eclipse Juno Client: Citi Real Estate Lending  Company: TCS TCS BANCS Reinsurance (February 2013 – May 2014): Roles and Responsibilities: Here I was involved as a front end as well as back end developer. Here the UIs were developed using JSP, Scriplets, and JavaScript. For storing data we used JPA concept using Hibernate and for controlling and retrieving data we were provided Stored Procedure. By calling the stored procedures from Data Access Object (DAO) class we used to handle the insurance related data. Environment: Core Java 6, JSP, Hibernate  Application Server: Weblogic IDE: BEA 10 Client: TCS Internal  Company: TCS GE commercial and Finance (May 2012 – January 2013): This a project under General Electronics (GE) group Client. Here I worked in a module called CFD (Customer Feedback Data). In this application GE handles all vehicle related data which are being used inside TCS or outside. So feedback data of customers are being handled in CFD module. Here I have worked as a service developers using Spring framework. Roles and Responsibilities: In this project basically my role was as a Service Developer. In this project basically the front end or the GUIs are developed using GWT. But my role war to develop service classes so that from GUI those service classes can be called to perform various operation like data saving, data retrieving and all various functionality based on client requirements. Here we used to follow Spring 3 Framework and java 6.  Here we have also implemented JPA concept using Hibernate. .In this project we used eclipse as IDE and IBM websphere 7 as application server. Here we used to build the modules using Maven tool. Environment: Java 6, Spring 3, Hibernate  Application Server: IBM Websphere 7  IDE: Eclipse Client: GE Group Client  Company: TCS IPMS (Integrated Project Management System)( May 2010 – April 2012): IPMS is an internal project of TCS. All internal project related tasks are developed here. Eg Timesheet which is an internal application where every employee fills-up their total working hours per day at TCS. So this application has been developed and is maintained in this project. Apart from that in this project I have worked on some application like HR TCS Alumni Portal, Leadership Review Management (LRM). HR TCS Alumni Portal is an application or we can say it is a portal for ex TCS employees where they can keep contact with TCS and can apply all official task like Form 16, PF Withdrawal etc. This site also provide all latest news of TCS so that the ex-employees can get to know about it. This application has been developed using JSF Framework. Leadership Review Management (LRM) is also an application which is used for TCS’s internal purpose. Using this application the feedback process is done of a supervisor. Here the lower level can give feedback to the upper level. Based on the feedback Upper level gets their rating. This is basically a review process of supervisors where supervisors will be rated based on the feedback given by their subordinates. This application has been developed using JSF Framework. Roles and Responsibilities: In both of these above mentioned project I was involved as a developer. Based on the requirements we have to develop the web pages of the application using JSF as front end and Core java as back end. Here we used to follow the JSF framework which supports MVC architecture. So for UI designing we have to write code on JSF and for data retrieving, data saving from/to database we have to write java classes name as Data Access Object (DAO) where we have to implement the JDBC connection to the database using Core java code. For handling the data and controlling the application we have to implement Bean classes where we used to control all the functionality of the application by using simple java functions. For data retrieving and storing we were provided stored procedures (SP). By calling those SPs from DAO class we used to handle data. Environment: Java, JSF 2.0, JDBC  Application Server: Weblogic IDE: BEA 10 Client: TCS Internal  Company: TCS ILP Training (February 2010 – April 2010): This is the initial learning program for newly joined associate in TCS.

I have extensive experience in Web/Internet, client/server and mainframe platforms with an emphasis on providing solutions that leverage the existing strengths of an organization to elevate the organization’s effectiveness.  Key accomplishments in my career include:  Taking key roles in two of the world’s largest projects of their kind: the AT&T billing system and the software for the two Olympic ring units in Vancouver  The AT&T billing system was considered by many to be impossible to deliver due to its size, complexity and tight project deadlines but was delivered on time and within budget and with full functionality, having compressed approximately 72 hours of processing into a 20-minute window.  The Olympic rings units are the world’s largest CAN-bus structures and their dimensions, coupled with the limits of the processor speed on each LED unit pushes the technology to the limit.  I also added the ability for two-way email communication with the rings for authorized contacts, allowing the rings to communicate statuses and warn of impending malfunctions as well as allow the operators to request patterns, ring status, and tests via email.  The recovery of over $36M in funds through the development and analysis of an integrated enterprise data warehouse and the discovery of over $500M in lost financial assets for a major Wall Street brokerage firm.  Successfully integrating disparate software products and platforms to deliver effective solutions to unusual business situations.  The chief concern of these projects was to provide a high degree of functionality with a minimum of investment and retraining.  Proactively reporting on project gaps and assuming lead roles in a number of high profile projects to deliver projects within their mandated delivery dates and budgets.  By recognizing gaps in team or system functionality, I provided solutions that bridged the gap prior to the project experiencing setbacks due to these deficiencies.  I have a solid track record of uniting my experience, analytical abilities, and problem-solving skills with an excellent work ethic to deliver innovative, adaptive and effective solutions to many business problems.  technical skills  Methodologies Agile, Traditional (Waterfall), Continuous Integration, Rational Unified Approach (RUP)  Industries Provincial and Federal governments, International Olympic Committee, transportation, forestry, telecommunications, financial, banking, health care, environment, engineering, asset management, education, legal, mining, manufacturing, travel, human resources, software sales.

Some of the features include:   Complete account reconciliation features with a point-in-time feature to provide a concise recreation of the connecting systems state at the time of the transaction;   The system is AR-agnostic, meaning it can interact with any existing AR system via it’s RESTful architecture;   Enhanced account registration that provides secure access to account records for all qualifying users while preserving privacy; and   The ability to operate in a disconnected mode, independent of a current connection to an attached Accounts Receivable system.  Reconciliation of the payment with the account will occur whenever the A/R system is available.  Highlight The system is designed to be easily enhanced to allow the system to function with 99.999% availability regardless of the state of the attached A/R systems, allowing them to receive payments while unavailable for processing, far in excess of the original uptime requirements of the system.

During the brief time available to develop the software, a number of features were added and enhancements were made to improve the speed and stability of the software.  In addition to the ability to create and edit shows for the rings as well as monitoring the state of each light, the rings provide status information to selected recipients via email either on demand or when certain performance parameters are met and they can also receive commands via email to perform certain functions after interrupting the existing processes, then continuing with the abbreviated process.  Highlight I was introduced to the project just a few weeks before the unveiling of the Coal Harbour ring unit.  Despite the severe time constraints, the requirement to learn a new code base and a new technology, I was able to enhance the functionality, reliability and performance of the rings as well as adding features to the rings such as autonomous bi-directional communications with the rings via email.

Nov 2018– Till date  RPA Developer (Automation Anywhere 11.2)     1.Non-Monetary Validation:   Overview: The business process that is being evaluated is for the Non-Mon Validation of accounts in the FDR system. Non-Mons are defined as the identity of a population requiring a value change in FDR. For example, NM115 refers to a 52-byte message for a certain account. This process is owned by the Process Delivery/Data Delivery team within the Marketing Solutions department.  For any campaign with a fulfillment portion or any campaign where a value must be updated in the FDR system, a Non-Mon is required as an output file. The team conducts a Non-Mon Validation to ensure the correct account has been updated in FDR as required. There are about 10-20 different Non-Mon types for which associated information must be updated and/or validated within FDR. When applying a separation, the team must provide QA audit reports to help auditors validate whether separations and criteria have been applied as required and for other compliance reasons. Currently, the process is that a Non-Mon file is created by Campaign Operations (COPs) and then sent for approval. Once approved by all parties, the file is shipped to FDR. Once the file is shipped, the values will be updated in FDR. Then, a copy of that file is pasted by a member of COPs on a different location in SAS Grid Server; from that copy, a sample file is exported into Excel of the NMs and account numbers for validation purposes. Someone from the team will then manually pick 4-5 random accounts for each Non-Mon and verify that the necessary values (based on the NM number) are updated correctly in FDR. The team will compare the values in the NM Dumps file created (in Excel) against the relevant FDR screen. They will repeat this manual comparison for all other accounts sampled, for each NM. If errors are found, the team will then manually fix this via their own process.  Responsibilities:  Played a role as Sr. Developer.

Single sign-on (SSO) with external identity providers  Created application NodeJs and Deployed on Heroku for verification of customers  Integrated SalesForce with Heroku The SSO process all happens with lightning speed, but a few steps are involved.  The user tries to access Salesforce.   Salesforce recognizes the SSO request and generates a SAML request.   Salesforce redirects the SAML request back to the browser.   The browser redirects the SAML request to the external identity provider.   The identity provider verifies the user’s identity and packages the SAML assertion containing the user authentication.   The identity provider sends the SAML assertion to the browser.   The browser redirects the assertion to Salesforce.   Salesforce verifies the assertion.   The user is now signed in and can access Salesforce. Integration with their other banking system like ATM, Credit card and other Products with Salesforce using service cloud.
